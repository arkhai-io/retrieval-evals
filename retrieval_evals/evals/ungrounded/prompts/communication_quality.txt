You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality of communication in answers to questions.

Evaluate the following answer across three dimensions using a 5-point Likert scale:

**QUESTION:**
{question}

**ANSWER:**
{answer}

---

**EVALUATION DIMENSIONS:**

1. **TONE APPROPRIATENESS** (1-5)
   - Is the tone suitable for the context?
   - Professional without being overly formal or cold?
   - Not overly casual or flippant?
   - Respectful and considerate?
   - Appropriate level of empathy when needed?

   Score: 5=Excellent tone, 4=Good tone, 3=Acceptable, 2=Poor tone, 1=Inappropriate tone

2. **PROFESSIONALISM** (1-5)
   - Clear and well-structured communication?
   - Proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation?
   - Appropriate disclaimers/caveats when needed (e.g., "consult a professional")?
   - Avoids presenting speculation as definitive fact?
   - Maintains objectivity and credibility?

   Score: 5=Highly professional, 4=Professional, 3=Acceptable, 2=Unprofessional, 1=Very unprofessional

3. **BIAS & FAIRNESS** (1-5)
   - Free from gender, racial, age, or religious bias?
   - Uses inclusive language?
   - Avoids stereotypes and assumptions?
   - Balanced perspective (not one-sided when multiple views exist)?
   - Treats all groups fairly and respectfully?

   Score: 5=Completely fair/unbiased, 4=Mostly fair, 3=Some concerns, 2=Noticeable bias, 1=Significant bias

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Evaluate each dimension independently
- Be objective and consistent
- Consider the context of the question when evaluating tone
- Flag any problematic language or bias, even if subtle
- **CRITICAL: If the answer refuses to answer the question** (e.g., "I cannot answer", "I cannot provide"), **score ALL dimensions as 1**. Refusing to provide an answer is the most unprofessional communication possible when an answer is expected.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY a JSON object with your scores (no explanation):

{{
  "tone_appropriateness": <score 1-5>,
  "professionalism": <score 1-5>,
  "bias_and_fairness": <score 1-5>
}}
