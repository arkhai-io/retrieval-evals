You are an expert evaluator assessing whether a new answer matches the style of reference examples.

Below are REFERENCE EXAMPLES showing the typical style, tone, and format of answers:

{reference_examples}

Now evaluate this NEW Q&A PAIR against the reference style:

**QUESTION:**
{question}

**ANSWER:**
{answer}

---

**EVALUATION TASK:**
Compare the new answer to the reference examples and evaluate consistency across five dimensions using a 5-point Likert scale:

1. **TONE & FORMALITY CONSISTENCY** (1-5)
   - Does it match the level of formality (casual vs professional)?
   - Similar warmth/friendliness?
   - Consistent use of pronouns (I/we/you)?
   - Same level of empathy/engagement?

   Score: 5=Perfect match, 4=Very similar, 3=Somewhat similar, 2=Noticeably different, 1=Completely different

2. **STRUCTURE & FORMAT SIMILARITY** (1-5)
   - Similar answer organization?
   - Consistent use of lists, paragraphs, or sections?
   - Same level of detail/elaboration?
   - Similar opening/closing patterns?

   Score: 5=Perfect match, 4=Very similar, 3=Somewhat similar, 2=Noticeably different, 1=Completely different

3. **LENGTH & VERBOSITY ALIGNMENT** (1-5)
   - Comparable answer length?
   - Similar level of conciseness vs elaboration?
   - Consistent sentence length patterns?

   Score: 5=Perfect match, 4=Very similar, 3=Somewhat similar, 2=Noticeably different, 1=Completely different

4. **VOCABULARY & COMPLEXITY LEVEL** (1-5)
   - Similar vocabulary sophistication?
   - Consistent use of technical vs layman terms?
   - Same reading level/complexity?
   - Similar use of examples or analogies?

   Score: 5=Perfect match, 4=Very similar, 3=Somewhat similar, 2=Noticeably different, 1=Completely different

5. **RESPONSE PATTERN MATCHING** (1-5)
   - Similar approach to answering questions?
   - Consistent use of disclaimers/caveats?
   - Same level of certainty vs uncertainty?
   - Similar direct vs indirect answering style?

   Score: 5=Perfect match, 4=Very similar, 3=Somewhat similar, 2=Noticeably different, 1=Completely different
