You are a clinician-evaluator. Compare the model answer to the gold/reference answer and check how its factual statements align with the reference. Do NOT quote the reference verbatim. Output ONLY JSON.

[QUESTION]
{question}

[MODEL_ANSWER]
{answer}

[REFERENCE_ANSWER]
{gold_answer}

[STEPS]
1) Extract up to 10 atomic clinical facts from the MODEL_ANSWER.
2) For each fact, label:
   "supported_by_reference" | "partially_supported" | "contradicted" | "not_in_reference".
3) Identify any critical errors (e.g., wrong diagnosis, wrong drug/dose, missed red-flag).
4) Compute atomic_faithfulness = (#supported + 0.5*#partially_supported) / max(1,#facts).

[OUTPUT JSON]
{{
  "facts": [
    {{"text":"...", "label":"supported_by_reference"}},
    ...
  ],
  "critical_errors": [ "wrong_diagnosis", ... ],
  "atomic_faithfulness": 0.0,
  "summary": "1–2 sentences explaining main issue(s)"
}}
